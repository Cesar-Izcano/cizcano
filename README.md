# About me
Hey! This is Cesar. My alias at 42 Wolfsburg was cizcano. I only completed the Piscine there. 
I'm currently working at Simply (formerly JoyTunes) as a customer service representative. I held previous positions in the same industry at Sitel Group (now known as Fundever). 
I have a master's degree in South European Studies from the University of Glasgow and a BA degree in Political Science from UNAN-Managua.
I have a personal interest in data analysis and data engineering.
